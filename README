This repository contains the R code for a series of predictive models used to identify mammalian mesopredator scats to species based on morphology.

The data used to build these models are from a set of mtDNA-verified coyote, bobcat and gray fox scats collected over a two year period along the central coast of California. Traits measured include: scat diameter, scat length, total dry mass, length of taper, taper index (taper length/scat diameter), and number of scat pieces. We also recorded the date, GPS points, the location of the scat on the trail, the relative age of the scat based on weathering, and whether or not the scat appeared ropey or segmented (or both).
